Users need to be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## Overview/Notes

For this challenge, you're given the option to pull data from a JSON file, which is what I opted for. The JSON file is hosted locally, so there's really not need to make any external API calls or anything for this, but I suppose if I ever needed practice, I could move the data to an external database and refactor my code accordingly. As for styling the project, I went with Styled Components as per usual. It could be nice to zhush it up a bit more and add simple transitions when toggling between weekly, monthly, and daily data.

## Tech Stack
- React, bootstrapped with CRA
